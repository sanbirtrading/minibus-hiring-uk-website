This will insure that the work can be followed through safely and legally. The driver will choose the route, depending on external conditions such as road work, weather or any other factors that may affect the route chosen. The only exception to this rule would be if the customer agreed to a specific route in writing beforehand, to which the driver agreed to. Though the driver will try to choose the shortest route, sometimes external factors can hinder this, however no discounts will be given if the shortest route is not chosen, as this is not in our hands. During all journeys, stops can be arranged, both for the satisfaction and ease of the customers and, for longer journeys, to abide by the law and allow breaks and rests for the driver too. If there is a return journey required, the vehicle(s) may not stay at the same destination so it/they are be accessible to passengers unless it is scheduled to happen beforehand.</p><p>We will venture to complete journeys in the expected time, and reach destinations on time, and we will, if asked to do so, give the most accurate estimates for destination times and journey times, especially for journeys that require specific timings such as airport bookings and weddings. Regardless of that, we are not able to take responsibility for any delays, if they are out of our hands, in cases where there are unexpected problems on the motorways or roads, or any weather conditions, as these situations are out of our hands completely. We do recommend that if the timings for the journey are especially important for the event, one should ensure against the risks beforehand by perhaps leaving earlier, as customer satisfaction and happiness is a priority.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">2.0 Delays</h3> <p>As mentioned in 1.0, we cannot in any circumstance take any responsibility for circumstances out of our control. This includes: traffic on the roads, accidents between vehicles on the roads, extreme weather condition such as heavy rain/hail or snow or any other events that occur outside of our control, though this is very rare. Our drivers insure that they reach the pick-up destination on time every time, however, again, if any delays are caused due to adverse conditions outside of our control, we will try to help the situation as much as we can, however delaysâ€™ consequences cannot be something we can take responsibility for.</p><p>If for any reason, a minibus is delayed for more than an hour to the destination, a refund may be an option, depending on the circumstances, however the likelihood of these sorts of extreme delays are very slim. If we cannot bring in any replacement for a delayed minibus within 4 hours of the expected time and so to continue with the journey, the customer arranges different transport from another company, they will be entitled to a full refund for that part of the journey (if it is a return journey, and one leg of it was delayed, that half will be refunded).</p><p>If a larger minibus is available, then we do have the right to send the larger minibus in, at no extra cost to the customer, unless the minibus arrives in a bigger size due to an increase in the number of passengers.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">1.2 Luggage</h3> <p>We take as much care of passengersâ€™ luggage as we can, ensuring there is enough space on the minibus for the planned amount for luggage. Regardless of this care, however, we cannot take responsibility for any damage caused to the luggage, as this is not in the driversâ€™ hands. We do tell customers to never leave any valuables on the minibus, as any theft of luggage is not our responsibility, so to be on the safe side, we do not allow anything valuable to be left on the vehicle.</p><p>We strongly recommend insurance of valuables that are of high value, as we do not want anything to be lost or stolen from our customers. If anything is left on the minibus after the passengers have left, they will be collected and safely stored, and will be kept there until they are claimed by the passengers.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">1.3 Drivers Working Hours</h3> <p>There are specific time periods that a driver can work for, and this is a legal requirement that drivers must work in. It is totally against the law for drivers to work beyond these specific hours. ABC Travel will always arrange the journey schedules so that minimal delay is caused to the journey, and rest stops are considered when giving passengers time frames for each journey. The customer cannot, under any circumstances, move away from the planned timings, unless arranged beforehand, as we cannot take responsibility for any delays caused due to this. If delays are caused by the customer, we have the right to change the journey or alter it slightly to adapt, in order to follow the law, so that our drivers are not working for excess hours, against the law.</p><p>We will venture to complete journeys in the expected time, and reach destinations on time, and we will, if asked to do so, give the most accurate estimates for destination times and journey times, especially for journeys that require specific timings such as airport bookings and weddings. Regardless of that, we are not able to take responsibility for any delays, if they are out of our hands, in cases where there are unexpected problems on the motorways or roads, or any weather conditions, as these situations are out of our hands completely. We do recommend that if the timings for the journey are especially important for the event, one should ensure against the risks beforehand by perhaps leaving earlier, as customer satisfaction and happiness is a priority.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">2.0 Customer Responsibilities</h3> <p>ABC Travel will always expect the passengers to behave and be respectful on journeys, and any abusive or intoxicated behavior will under no circumstances be tolerated. The Driver can also leave a journey incomplete if he truly believes he considers any customer to be behaving in any way that could be dangerous for the other persons on board, the driver or the fleet vehicle. The driver can decide if drinking on board the vehicle is allowed, preferably decided beforehand, however, for some sporting events drinking in the vehicle is legally prohibited and all passengers must abide to the decision of the driver.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">2.1 Vehicle Damage</h3> <p>We put a lot of effort into keeping all of our vehicles clean and at a high standard. Due to this effort, the customer will have to be responsible for any damage done to the vehicle, be it inside or outside of the vehicle. If the vehicle, due to the customersâ€™ actions, requires extra cleaning, the customer will be expected to pay the sum required to clean the vehicle again.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">2.2 Deposits</h3> <p>If the booking is for more than 7 days into the future a 30% deposit should be paid at the point of booking, with the balance to be paid no less than 7 working days before transport, unless agreed otherwise. If the booking is within 7 days the balance will need to paid in full.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">3. Payment, Cancellation and Additional Charges</h3> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">3.1 Payment</h3> <p>All charges quoted to the Customer shall be exclusive of VAT which ABC Travel shall add to its charges at the appropriate rate.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">3.2 Payment by Invoice</h3> <p>At the point of booking each Customer will be asked for their preferred option for payment. For Companies, Schools, Government bodies and Institutions (or any other organisation agreed in writing by ABC Travel from time to time) payment on receipt of a valid invoice may be acceptable.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">3.3 Alternative payment methods</h3> <p>BACâ€™s, cheque or cash payments are acceptable as long as this is agreed in writing with ABC Travel in advance.</p><p>Irrespective of the payment method chosen â€“ unless it has been specifically agreed in writing by ABC Travel â€“ the customer must pay for the services in full and in cleared funds 7 full working days prior to the performance of the services. Any service which has not been fully paid for 7 days prior to departure will be AUTOMATICALLY CANCELLED in line with the cancellation charges as outlined in these terms (see below).</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">3.4 Cancellation Policy</h3> <p>If a booking is cancelled in writing by the Customer with more than 7 working days left before the date of travel, we will deduct 10% and refund the remaining balance.</p><p>If a booking is cancelled by the Customer with less than 7 working daysâ€™ notice, any deposit paid will be forfeited.</p><p>Deposits are not refundable on bookings cancelled by the customer.</p><p>No cash refunds. Any refunds will be issued back to customers bank account.</p><p>There are no refunds for ferry, tunnel or toll fees.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">3.5 Additional Charges</h3> <p>Unless, it has been otherwise agreed, the hire price will not include any group catering, tickets, admission charges, ferries/tunnels, road tolls or parking. At your request we may make these types of arrangements for you, but we would do so as your agent. This means that any terms and conditions applicable to that transaction by that supplier (e.g. relating to payment, cancellation, etc.) would be as binding on you as they would if you had made these arrangements yourself. We will seek your acceptance of any such terms and conditions and not expend any money on your behalf until you have made similar payment to us.</p><p>ABC Travel reserves the right to charge the customer for driverâ€™s accommodation at the time of the booking should the length of a trip go beyond 24 hours. It is at the sole discretion of ABC Travel to apply the costs of the accommodation, whether or not the driver utilises the accommodation, or if for operational purposes the driver is required to drive back to the coach depot and return the following day to collect the passengers. ABC Travel will not be held liable for any request for a reimbursement from the customer in the event the accommodation is not used.</p><p>For longer trips in terms of hours/mileage ABC Travel needs to comply with all regulations with regards to driverâ€™s hours. The booking quote that you will have received (unless agreed in writing) specifically excludes the requirement for a second driver or driver accommodation. Our operations team will work with you to produce an agreed itinerary which will minimise as far as possible, the need for any additional costs. If such costs are unavoidable we will advise the customer of them (if at all possible) more than 7 days prior to travel thus allowing the customer the option of cancelling the booking at no further cost. If bookings are made less than 7 days before travel we will advise of additional costs within 48 hours of booking.</p><p>Ferries and Eurotunnel can only be booked on receipt of cleared funds. Please be aware that these bookings are subject to 3rd Party availability on receipt of cleared funds.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">3.6 Booking Confirmations and Amendments</h3> <p>It is the responsibility of the Customer to check the Booking Confirmation, once received, for its accuracy and completeness. This is the document that ABC Travel relies upon for the trip and it is important that any errors are notified to us as soon as possible.</p><p>If a customer requires an amendment to a booking, the amendment will only be considered as implemented when the Customer has it confirmed in writing by ABC Travel in terms of a new, replacement, Booking Confirmation. If an updated Booking Confirmation has not been received by the customer with the updated details, then the customer must assume that the existing booking has not been amended.</p><p>It is the customerâ€™s responsibility to ensure with ABC Travel that all trip details are complete and correct and at no time should verbal amendments be considered as confirmation of a change to an existing booking.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">4. Complaints</h3> <p>If Customers have a complaint about their booking or trip they should contact ABC Travel as soon as possible in writing (by email) and ABC Travel will try to resolve the issue as well as possible. Customer Service office hours are from 8am until 5.30pm Monday â€“ Friday. Our office is unable to assist with this type of enquiry on Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays. If youâ€™re writing to complain please provide your booking reference number on your e-mail, and include your daytime and evening telephone numbers. Any resolutions or compensatory measures offered (if any) by ABC Travel are at the strict discretion of the management of ABC Travel.</p><p>Any issue must be raised within 14 days of the initial travel date.</p></div><div class="b-terms-main"> <h3 class="b-car-details__section-title ui-title-inner">5.
